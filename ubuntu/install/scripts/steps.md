## Setting up Ubuntu environment

1. upload ssh private keys to `~/.ssh/` with mode 600
1. run `ubuntu/install/scripts/1.sh`
1. re-login or reboot
1. run `ubuntu/install/scripts/2.sh`

and done!

Any change done to my own environment should be reflected onto this repository,
unless that change contains any private information that cannot be made public.

However, just like ssh keys, append manual step to the above list
if the configuration can safely be made anonymous.
